## User Story

AS a developer
I WANT to update an existing application to include additional vehicle types
SO THAT I am able to comprehend and work with existing code bases.

## Description TypeScript and OOP
The task is to update an existing TypeScript command-line application that builds and uses cars to have additional options for motorbikes and trucks. This program allows users to either select a vehicle from a set of pre-defined options or create a new custom vehicle. After selection, users can perform various actions with their chosen vehicle. The user is returned to the actions menu after each action until they decide to exit the application. The README includes sections for Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
